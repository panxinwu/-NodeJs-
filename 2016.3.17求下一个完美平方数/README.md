### 输入任意一个数字，求该数字是否为完美平方数并返回下一个完美平方数

> You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?

> Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

> If the parameter is itself not a perfect square, than -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is positive.

#### example 

- findNextSquare(121) --> returns 144
- findNextSquare(625) --> returns 676
- findNextSquare(114) --> returns -1 since 114 is not a perfect
